# Giffz
This is my student project in web-development is a social network site "Giffz" for posting GIF-images. 
### It's based on Django 3.0.7, using SQLite as main database for this site. 
### Technonlogies that used in this project:
- Ajax-request to refresh like on post without refreshing page
- Django-modeltranslation to change the language on the site for a specific user(store in Cookies)
- Telegram Api to post info in chat-bot that the user is logged in on the sire
- JS and Boostrap CSS for beautiful animations and desing of site (I'm not so strong at Front-end)
### In future
There is no actual avtorization and registration models for specific user. Every user is made as superuser in terminal. 
In order to enter and see the site itself, follow the link and enter your login and password (admin/1111), you will enter as an administrator.
Maybe in future i'll add those features.
